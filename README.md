This is an escape game where you enter rooms and interaction with certain object to find notes with codes. It prints the game intro and when the user is ready the game starts. The program then begins and infinate loop that is exited after the user unlocks the main door. In the loop, the users is asked for a room to enter. The rooms are differentiate based off if the room has a lock(code) or not. If the room is locked, it ask the user if they went to unlock it. Once the room is unlocked, it is pernamently and unlocked room(the user will not have to enter the code again). Once the room is unlocked, its acts like a normal room. In a normal room, the inteeractions are displayed and the user is asked to choose one. The program prints dialouge based off the users input. If the interaction reveals a note, the contents of the note is added to the users inventory. That interaction will now have different dialouge.
